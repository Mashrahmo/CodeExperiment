# CodeExperiment
This modified code that I wrote will perform the following experiments and measure their execution times:

Addition of two integers.

Multiplication of two integers.

Direct multiplication (squaring) of two doubles.

Using Math.Pow to square two doubles.

Using Math.Sqrt to compute the square root of two doubles.


here we will see a short step-by-step explanation of code:
Explanation:
Generates 800,000 random pairs of doubles.
Measures the time it takes to add two integers from each pair.
Measures the time it takes to multiply two integers from each pair.
Measures the time it takes to square (multiply by itself) each double directly.
Measures the time it takes to square each double using Math.Pow.
Measures the time it takes to compute the square root of each double using Math.Sqrt.
Prints the elapsed time for each operation.
Compares the performance of addition vs. multiplication for integers.
Compares the performance of direct multiplication vs. Math.Pow vs. Math.Sqrt for doubles.
Provides insights into which operations are faster based on the measured execution times.
